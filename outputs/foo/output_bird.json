It then groups results by school, orders them by FRPM count in descending order.\n\n### **Step 2: For each returned school, get unabbreviated mailing address**\n\nAssuming ` schools` table has a full mailing address field, the simplest way is to include this in our select statement above. If it's split into different fields and we need the \"unabbreviated\" version (for simplicity we will assume \"unabbreviated\" here means containing all parts of an address), you would replace `s.MailingAddress` with whatever concatenation or function you use across multiple columns (`Address1, Address2, City, State, Zip`) to get a full mailing address.\n\n```sql\nSELECT s.CDSCode, \n       s.FullMailingAddress As UnabbreviatedMailingAddres\nFROM satscores sc\nJOIN schools s ON sc.cds = s.CDSCode\nWHERE (s.GSoffered LIKE '%K-12%' OR s.GSchassis LIKE '012') \n  AND s.NCESFRPMCount IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY s.CDSCode, s.FullMailingAddress\nORDER BY COUNT(s.FRMF) DESC;\n```\n\nTo get the exact school with the highest count, we could add a LIMIT clause at the end to only return one row:\n\n```sql\n... \n-- Add this before GROUP BY for the most recent (or highest-count) address in case ties exist.\nSELECT DISTINCT s.CDSCode, s.FullMailingAddress As UnabbreviatedMailingAddres,\n MAX(NCESFRPMCount) As NCESCount\n...\nORDER BY NCESCount DESC;\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nHowever, remember if there is a single best-performing school (highest count), this approach will return that one.", "fixed": true, "try_times": 3, "pred": "SELECT CDSCode, UnabbreviatedMailingAddress, \n       NCESFRPMCount from (\n  SELECT s.CDSCode, s.UnabbreviatedMailingAddress,\n         NCESFRPMCount, \n         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.CDSCode ORDER BY NCESFRPMCount DESC) As rn\n  FROM schools s \n         INNER JOIN frpm ON s.CDSCode = frpm.`CDSCode`\n         INNER JOIN satscores ON s.CDSCode = satscores.cds)\nWHERE rn = 1;"}
